Polynomial optimization problem solver and Semidefinite programming solver
=====

This Python package enables you to solve semidefinite programming problems. Also provides a tool to convert a polynomial optimization problem into semidefinite programme.

Usage
-----

For demo, please refer to the files [demoSDPSolver.py](https://github.com/PavelTrutman/POP-SDP/blob/master/demoSDPSolver.py) and [demoPOPSolver.py](https://github.com/PavelTrutman/POP-SDP/blob/master/demoPOPSolver.py). These files are self-explanatory.

Acknowledge
-----

I would like to thanks to Didier Henrion for introducing me into polynomial optimization.
